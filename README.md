# What is a Wallet
 A wallet is a piece of software or hardware that allows users to interact with the blockchain. Users can create an account that can send transactions and keep track of its balance and receive funds, create smart contracts, interact with decentralized applications and more.

There‚Äôs a lot of wallets to choose from, and any of them might make sense for you depending on your needs. Feel free to choose any wallet you like, but do some research before installing one for yourself.

<br/>

# üîë Understanding keypair
A keypair securely generates a private key and its cryptographically-derived public key. 

### Public Key
- Public key is known as the wallet's receiving address. 
- Public key may be shared and displayed freely. When another user is going to send some amount of cryptocurrency to a wallet, they need to know the wallet's receiving address.

### Private Key
- Private key is required to digitally sign any transactions to send cryptocurrencies to another address or to make any changes to the wallet. 
- The private key must never be shared. If someone gains access to the private key to a wallet, they can withdraw all the tokens it contains. 
- If the private key for a wallet is lost, any tokens that have been sent to that wallet's address are permanently lost.

If you want to be able to receive SOL tokens on the Solana blockchain, you first will need to create a wallet.
